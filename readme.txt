=== Smarter Archives ===

Stable tag: 3.2.5

Easily navigate the yearly and monthly archives of your blog.

== Description ==

When you use the `[smarter-archives]` shortcode anywhere in a post or a page, it gets replaced by a listing of every year since you started posting, with a list of links to each month for that year. However, the plugin is smart enough to know if you didn't create any content in any given month, and doesn't make a link for that month. See the **Screenshots** section for an example of it in action.

See the **Usage** section for a complete list of the arguments the shortcode takes, and how you can use them to customize your archives listing.

The month names are [internationalized with the WordPress translation API](http://codex.wordpress.org/I18n_for_WordPress_Developers). A POT file is included, and if you want to translate please feel free to do so and [submit a new pull request](https://github.com/robinadr/smarter-archives/pulls) on GitHub. If you do not know how to use GitHub, you can also [contact me directly](http://robinadr.com/contact). Here are the translations that have been done so far:

* Dutch (nl_NL)
* French (fr_FR)
* German (de_DE)
* Italian (it_IT)
* Spanish (es_ES)
* Russian (ru_RU)

The original concept for this plugin comes from the [Smart Archives](http://hypertext.net/projects/smartarchives/) plugin by Justin Blanton.

== Screenshots ==

1. An example of the plugin in action [on my website](http://robinadr.com/archives).

== Installation ==

1. Download the ZIP file and unzip it
2. Copy or upload the `smarter-archives` folder to your plugins folder (usually `wp-content/plugins/`)
3. Activate *Smarter Archives* in the admin
4. Put the `[smarter-archives]` shortcode where you want the listing to show
5. Enjoy.

== Usage ==

The `[smarter-archives]` shortcode takes these arguments (default values included):

* `mode` (default: `output`) -- if it's set to `output`, the plugin prints the listing. Set it to `false` to return the value
* `wrapper_class` (default: `smart-archives`) -- class given to the tag wrapped around the listing (`<div>` by default)
* `wrapper_tag` (default: `div`) -- tag wrapped around the listing
* `year_link_class` (default: `year-link`) -- class given to each year links
* `year_tag` (default: `p`) -- tag around each year group
* `year_class` (default: none) -- class for the tag around each year group
* `after_year` (default: `: `) -- value after the year and before the list of months
* `month_link_class` (default: `month-link`) -- class given to each month link
* `month_tag` (default: `span`) -- tag around each month
* `after_month` (default: `&nbsp;`) -- spacer between months
* `empty_month_class` (default: `empty-month`) -- class applied to empty months (can use this to gray them out)
* `order` (default: `DESC`) -- order the years are shown in (`ASC` for ascending, `DESC` for descending)

**Advanced Usage**

There is a function, `get_smarter_archives()`, that returns the raw array with the years, months, and post counts. You can use this for ultimate customization.

**Example Usage**

	[smarter-archives order="DESC" after_month="&bull;"]
